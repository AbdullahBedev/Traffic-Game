# Traffic Light Management Game - Development Plan (COMPLETE)


## Project Overview
A straightforward traffic management game where players control traffic lights at a single four-way intersection. The goal is to manage traffic flow efficiently, prevent accidents, and ensure no car waits longer than 30 seconds.

## Technical Stack
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Core game logic ✅
- **HTML5 Canvas API**: For rendering the game ✅
- **CSS**: For UI styling ✅
- **Standard Web Audio API**: For sound effects ✅

## Core Game Mechanics

### 1. Simple Four-Way Intersection
- One main intersection with four roads ✅
- Traffic lights at each entry point ✅
- Clear, bird's-eye 2D view (not isometric) ✅

### 2. Vehicle System
- Cars spawn from four directions ✅
- Cars follow simple paths through the intersection ✅
- Cars stop at red lights and proceed at green ✅
- Each car has a timer showing its wait time ✅

### 3. Traffic Light Controls
- Players can toggle each traffic light individually ✅
- Visual cues for traffic light states ✅
- Visual effects for light changes ✅

### 4. Scoring & Objectives
- Prevent accidents (cars colliding) ✅
- Keep wait times under 30 seconds per car ✅
- Score based on throughput (cars safely passing through) ✅

## Implementation Status

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Basic Setup: HTML structure, canvas, game loop, input handling
- ✅ Intersection Design: Four-way intersection with traffic lights
- ✅ Traffic Light System: Toggle controls, state management, auto-transition for yellow lights
- ✅ Vehicle System: Car spawning, movement, collision detection, traffic light obedience
- ✅ Pathfinding: Straight and curved paths with bezier curves for smooth turns
- ✅ Game Logic: Wait time tracking, scoring, failure conditions
- ✅ UI & Feedback: Score display, timer, flow rate, wait time indicators
- ✅ Visual Effects: Traffic light state changes, car collisions
- ✅ Sound System: Basic sound effects framework with mute toggle
- ✅ Sound Effects: Added actual sound files for game events 
- ✅ Performance Optimization: Implemented car object pooling for better performance
- ✅ Cross-browser Testing: Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- ✅ Mobile Device Compatibility: Optimized layout for mobile devices
- ✅ Bug Fixing and Final Polish: Completed all necessary tweaks and improvements
