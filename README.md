# Traffic Light Management Game

A simple, browser-based traffic management game where you control traffic lights at a four-way intersection. Keep the traffic flowing smoothly, prevent accidents, and make sure no car waits too long!

## How to Play

1. **Open the Game**: Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. **Choose Difficulty**: Select your preferred difficulty level:
   - Easy: Cars spawn every 3 seconds
   - Medium: Cars spawn every 2 seconds
   - Hard: Cars spawn every 1 second
3. **Click Start**: Begin the game!

- **Space Bar**: Pause/resume the game
- **‚òÄÔ∏è/üåô Button**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **üîä/üîá Button**: Toggle sound on/off

## Game Objectives

- **Prevent Accidents**: Don't let cars collide (3 accidents = game over)
- **Manage Wait Times**: Don't let any car wait more than 30 seconds
- **Maximize Flow**: Try to get as many cars through the intersection as possible

## Scoring

- +10 points for each car that successfully passes through
- -50 points for each accident

## Tips for Success

1. **Focus on Timing**: Create a rhythm for your light changes
2. **Watch for Critical Wait Times**: Cars with red timers are close to the 30-second limit
3. **Anticipate Collisions**: Cars can't stop in the middle of the intersection
4. **Use Yellow Lights**: Yellow lights will automatically turn red after 2 seconds
